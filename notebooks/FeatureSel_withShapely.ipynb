    "# Fast, intuitive\n",

    "## Methodologies\n",
    "1. FIlter methods\n",
    "Use ranking techniques to rank feature based on their relevance to the dependent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Wrapper methods\n",
    "Evluate feature subsets by training a model normally, possibly on different feature subsets, and selecting the subset that provides the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Embedded methods\n",
    "Incorporate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter methods\n",
    "Considered ranking methods since they are appplied to feature to rank their importance before classification or regression.\\\n",
    "Advantages\\\n",
    "- Scale well to large datasets while maintaining computational efficiency\n",
    "- Easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\\\n",
    "- Lack the ability to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "### WRapper methods\n",
    "Use the predictor as a black box and evaluate the performance of the ML models on subset of features.\\\n",
    "Advantages\\\n",
    "- Performs well in scenarios where feature interactions are important.\n",
    "- Easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\\\n",
    "- Their tendency to overfit on smaller datasets\n",
    "- High computational cost limits their applicability to big dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedded methods\n",
    "Incorporate feature selection directly into the model training process.\\\n",
    "Advantages\\\n",
    "- Embedded methods have the advantage of being integrated directly into the learning algo, which allows them to account for feature interactions naturally.\n",
    "- Better computational efficiency as compared to Wrapper Methods, they execute faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\\\n",
    "- Can be sensitive to choice of regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "From feature to shapley values\\\n",
    "- Shapley valuyes describe the contribution of each input featre to the value of a function.\n",
    "- The sum of shapley values across all features MUST equal the value of the function on that data point\n",
    "- For tree-based model, there is a fast algo for calculating them, implemented in shap package\n",
    "\n",
    "- To control for overfitting, lets look at shapley values oin the validation dataset\n",
    "- As Shapley values MUST add up to the final function value, let's do linear regression of the target on the SHapley Values\n",
    "    - For a perfect fit, all coefficients will be 1.0\n",
    "    - Negative coefficient means this feature is pull ing the function away\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refinement\n",
    "- Also works for classifier, by using logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Shap-select introduce a unique combination of interpretability, stat rigor, and computational efficiency.\n",
