    "# Causality - Mental Hygiene for Data Science\n",
    "Harness teh power of why with causal tools\\\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applicable or not, causality is good for mental hygiene\n",
    "- Causal Graphs - visual aids to articulate understanding of the mecahnism of a system\n",
    "\n",
    "### The allure and reality of causality\n",
    "- Real world decision require accountability\n",
    "- Accountability requires understanding\n",
    "- Standard ML are amazing but do not truly understand\n",
    "- They capture patterns not mechanism.\n",
    "- Association based decision can backfire due to misinterpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifting from \"what happened?\" (passive) to \"what would happen if\" (active)\\\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomised Control Trials\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "- Eliminates confounding factors\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "- Expensive to recruit\n",
    "- Feasibility - intervention might not be physically possible or ethical to conduct\n",
    "- Artificial setting of a lab\n",
    "- Not individualised\n",

    "- Some Causal questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Causual inference:\n",
    "- Is not a standard tool\n",

    "### A ML Paradox\n",
    ">Causation is not merely an aspect of statistics, it is an addition to statistics\n",

    "Properties\n",
    "- Articulates the practitioner's understanding of the underlying mechanism\n",

    "## Building DAG\n",
    "What is required\n",
    "- Domain expertise\n",
    "    - Speaking with experts\n",
    "    - Scanning literatures\n",
    "- Testing assumptions\n",
    "    - Requires reliable empirical data\n",

    "### Spectrum of DAG Building Complexity\n",
    "Depends on domain expertise and controls of the data generation process\n",
    "- Full control: over the data generation process: Synthetic / Simulated data\n",
    "- Partial control: RCTs, A/B tests\n",
    "- No control: Full observational - no true understanding directionality\n",

    "### DAGs as Visual Mental Hygiene\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Applicability with Idenfiability\n",
    "- A framework to assess minimal sets of parameters required to quantify a specific causal effect\n",
    "- Helps assess parameters as sufficient / necessary\n",
    "- Posssible benefit: Less data -> more pearameters\n",
